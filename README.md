# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Language-Detection
Deep learning language classification using RNN

This project presents a machine learning model architecture based on recurrent neural networks that takes a code snippet and predicts which programming language it is written in.

The dataset used was formed of 11103 snippets for train and 2995 snippets for test from 6 programming languages: C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML and SQL.
Each programming language is almost equally represented in the dataset.
The dataset is a subset of the dataset used in the [Deep Learning Language Detection](https://github.com/aliostad/deep-learning-lang-detection), where each snippet is cut in chunks of length 1000.
